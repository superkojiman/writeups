I use Chrome's desktop notifications when using Gtalk, and Growl notifications for other applications. I wanted a Growl style that looked like Chrome's desktop notifications, but was unable to find one after combing through Google searches. I finally said "screw it", and decided to make my own.

I looked at the included Growl styles and found that NotifyOSX by Daniel Bergey seemed to match the Chrome notification to some extent. After a bit of tinkering, I came up with something that looks similar enough. Tested on Growl 1.2.2.
