My first post on Blogger was on October 9, 2009. It's been a good run, and I've enjoyed using Blogger for quickly sharing things with the Internet. For various reason, I've grown tired of Blogger, and I've decided to migrate over to GitHub Pages. Making the transfer took a bit of time and trial and error. Octopress made the migration relatively simple and so far, I'm pretty happy with the results.

I've tried to make the transition as seamless as possible, but there are things that will break. For one, Blogger uses different URLs and I haven't found a way to map them to GitHub Pages. This means other blogs or search results that link to the old URL will end up in a 404 page. I'm not sure if there's a way around this, it's something I'll have to look into. 

Comments are another thing. I've gotten a few comments over the years, and I'm currently looking at ways to import Blogger comments into Disqus. Worst case scenario, the old comments stay with Blogger and I start fresh with new comments. 

Next, RSS feeds. You'll probably need to resubscribe to get updated feeds. I've also setup a FeedBurner at [http://feeds.feedburner.com/techorganic](http://feeds.feedburner.com/techorganic).

I think that's about it. The old blog can still be found at [http://techorganic.blogspot.com](http://techorganic.blogspot.com). I'll keep it up there but commenting will be closed and there won't be anymore updates.
